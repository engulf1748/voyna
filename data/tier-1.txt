# I'm not sure exactly what sort of domains to include, but I included a few 
# ones I generally consider authentic within their respestive class.
#
# I assume we're also including subdomains on top of these?
#
# I also assume we're going to be unbiased here and include _all_ objectively
# tier-one domains, like, for instance, facebook.com? If Facebook isn't
# objectively tier-one, I quit.
